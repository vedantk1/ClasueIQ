# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## âœ… Cleanup Completed Successfully

### Files Removed:

1. **Duplicate/Backup Files:**

   - `frontend/src/app/history/page.tsx.clean`
   - `frontend/src/app/history/page.tsx.new`

2. **Unused Utility Script:**

   - `backend/create_test_pdf.py`

3. **Build Artifacts & Cache:**

   - `frontend/.next/` (entire directory)
   - `frontend/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`
   - `backend/__pycache__/` (entire directory)
   - `backend/tests/__pycache__/` (entire directory)
   - `backend/.pytest_cache/` (entire directory)

4. **System Files:**
   - `.DS_Store` files (macOS metadata)

### Verification:

- âœ… All 42 tests still pass after cleanup
- âœ… No functional code was removed
- âœ… Project structure remains intact
- âœ… MongoDB migration functionality preserved

### Impact:

- **Disk Space Saved:** Estimated 10-50MB
- **Files Removed:** 6 explicit files + cache directories
- **Risk Level:** Low (only removed duplicates and generated files)

### Benefits:

- Cleaner project structure
- Reduced repository size
- Eliminated duplicate/backup files
- Removed build artifacts that will be regenerated as needed

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The codebase is now clean and ready for:

- Git commits without unnecessary files
- Fresh builds that will regenerate cache as needed
- Deployment with a clean, minimal footprint

All core functionality remains intact and the MongoDB migration is still fully operational!
